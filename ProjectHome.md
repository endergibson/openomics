# `OpenOmics` #
`OpenOmics` ambition is to create a global peer-to-peer collaborative network for bioinformatics. A decentralized network based on the principles of openness, objective merit of its participants and collaboration; and meeting the technical needs identified by the Global Alliance.

As first motivation, the network is aimed at supporting an open, unified, collaborative, decentralized, scalable and fault-tolerant repository providing real-time consultation services of genomic, phenotypic and environmental data.
