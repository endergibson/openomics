> _"To improve human health, data resources and informatics capabilities must be enabled for use in clinical care. Moreover, as genome sequencing moves into the clinic, health care will become a primary location for collecting the phenotypic and genetic data needed to create learning systems for research and clinical care."_

[Michael Pellini (Foundation Medicine CEO)](http://forumblog.org/2014/01/genomics-big-data-revolutionizing-cancer-care/):
> _"Information technology must be the key enabler. Information exchange across the global cancer community is critical for success in the fight against the disease, allowing physicians to easily access, share and analyse genomic and clinical data to help inform treatment decisions. When genomic information for a given patient is combined with information about their clinical history, and mined along with thousands of other patients, patterns may be discerned that could guide treatment. Technology will allow us to incorporate what we learn every day in clinical experience into our collective knowledge and accelerate the move towards precision medicine."_
